# Development
To create this program, me and my group members utilized Hibernate and SQLite to build the database portion of the app. For the user interface, I contributed by using JavaFx to develop the login page, view the course review page, and add the course review page. I also added some custom exception errors as well as adding some J-UNIT testing. We focused on using Model, View, Controller (MVC) as our design structure for our program.
